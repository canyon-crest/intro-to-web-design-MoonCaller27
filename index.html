        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <img src="images/nlp.png" class="float-right-image">
<p>Hi! I’m Kaden, and I’m currently 15 years old. I am a sophomore at Canyon Crest Academy. I do a variety of activities, such as playing basketball, piano, and trombone. I do many, many school extracurricular activities. Some of the most prolific ones are CyberPatriot, math team, and robotics. I am also an AI enthusiast, particularly in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing">NLP</a>. Additionally, I volunteer as a peer tutor, teaching math at Casa De Amistad. </p>

    <h3>Facts about cryptography</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>First invented by Egyptians in 1900 BC</li>
        <li>Julius Caesar used Caesar cipher to encrypt messages</li>
        <li>Many key ciphers were created, but most of them were broken</li>
        <li>The two most secure ciphers today are RSA and AES</li>

<p>From a young age, I’ve always been interested in computers. I just think they are so cool because although it looks like they don’t do much to normal users, in reality they are extremely complex. The world is slowly shifting into an age of technology, so it is crucial to learn about computers. On the topic of computers, I’ve been doing cybersecurity for over 4 years. <a href="crypto.html">Cryptography</a> is my strong suit, but I can do the other subjects as well. Cryptography deals with the field of making sure messages can be securely sent to the intended recipient, with no eavesdropping involved. I’m currently taking APCSP, and it’s cool to learn about all the different aspects of computer science that I didn’t know before. I like computer science because it's a new, novel, up-and-coming field that will surely attract many curious minds. It is necessary to be mindful of harmful effects too, however. Computers can facilitate addiction, and with the rise of AI, more and more security and privacy concerns are being breached. More on the topic of computers: Computer Science is split into three fields: theoretical, engineering, and application computer science. theoretical computer science deals with the parts that are not built yet, the ideas behind the computers. This involves P vs NP problems, time comlpexity, graph theory, etc. The second layer is computer engineering. This involves hardware and operating systems. The final layer is applications. This includes things such as machine learning, computer vision, and virtual reality. There are many others, but that's the beauty of computer science: when you think you've learned everything, there's always more to explore!</p>

  <h3>CyberPatriot</h3></a>
<p>My biggest passion surrounds computers, but the activity that surrounds this the most is CyberPatriot. CyberPatriot is a cybersecurity defense corporation organized by the Air Force Association. There are generally 3 subjects: Windows, Linux, and Cisco. Windows and Linux are two different types of operating systems, while Cisco does networking things. I do both Windows and Linux. In general, this competition is very fun, and there are chances to go to nationals in March. I haven’t been there before, so I hope I can go there this year. It would be a very fun experience. In the past, I have gotten 9th place nationally, which was unfortunately not enough to go to nationals that year. Primarily CyberPatriot has quite a few rounds, including rounds 1 and 2, the state round, semifinals, and then nationals. Everyone participates in round 1, round 2, and state round, while only the best move on to the semifinals and then nationals. When moving on to the semifinals, you are split into tiers. I have consistently been in Platinum (top) tier for most of my CyberPatriot career. </p>
